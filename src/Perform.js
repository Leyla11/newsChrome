            Memory Saver automatically frees up memory from tabs you <br />
            havenâ€™t used in a while. This gives active tabs and other apps <br />
            more computer resources and keeps Chrome speedy. You can <br />
            manage Memory Saver and which sites it frees up memory from <br />
            in settings.
